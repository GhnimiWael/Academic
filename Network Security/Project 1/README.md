- GNS VM
- Python (version 2 or 3) - For the automation Side

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can clone this repository and open the GNS3 project file located in the gns3/ directory.

### Usage
To start the network simulation, follow these steps:

- Start the GNS VM and GNS3 software.
- Open the gns3/Backbone Model Setup Mockup IP-MPLS.gns3 project file.
- Power on the devices in the topology by clicking the "Play" button in the GNS3 toolbar.
- Use the console tabs in the GNS3 interface to configure the devices and test the network.
- Or, Automate it using the mentioned scripts.
